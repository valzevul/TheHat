The Hat is a word guessing game, also known as Charades, written in Swift for the iOS platform. In the form most played today, it is an acting game in which one player acts out a word or phrase, often by miming similar-sounding words, and the other players guess the word or phrase. This version is based on the server api by parallel-p/thehat.
